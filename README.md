# Learning Assembly Language

These are some exercise programs on my way to learning assembly language
programming. I have tried both [gas](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/GAS_Syntax) and [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/).

## Todos

* extract a set of useful library functions: (atoi, itoa, reverse_string)
* guess a number game
* write some slightly more complex programs
* word count (wc) program
* use malloc to simulate arrays, strings, and structs
* word summary program
* learn to use lea
* digging into binary opcode format to understand things at a lower level
* maybe learn to use the stack pointer to look upwards in the stack
* learn writing asm for the Arduino
* write into a string buffer (done)
* reverse the string (done)
* figure out how to use debugger
* print a number w/o printf - (done)
* convert a string number into a number (done)

## Videos

I made a [couple of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3DCb7dxmvVudikqDeQW8tNL) on this topic.
